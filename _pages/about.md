I am a first-year PhD student at UC Berkeley. I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science. Previously, I was an undergraduate student in Yao Class, Tsinghua University.

During my undergrad, I was extremely fortunate to be advised by kind and inspiring professors. I am always so grateful to them.
