I became a fan of billiards in my junior year. [Here](../img/billiards.jpeg) is a picture of me playing billiards. 

I enjoy (watching) standup comedies. Checkout [Comedy Club China](https://www.facebook.com/comedyclubchina/) for best English comedies in Beijing!

I visted [BARC](https://barc.ku.dk/) (Basic Algorithm Research Copenhagen) for two months. It was such a lovely place full of friendly people. See [here](../img/barc1.jpg) and [here](../img/barc2.jpg) for pictures. 

I used to do competitive programming. My [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) handle was [WuHongxun](https://codeforces.com/profile/WuHongxun). I was an administrator of [Univsersal Online Judge](https://uoj.ac/). (We have the most challenging puzzles among all online judges in China!) [Here](https://uoj.ac/user/profile/WuHongxun) is my account on UOJ.
